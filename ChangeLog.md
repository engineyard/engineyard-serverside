# ChangeLog

## NEXT

  * When git fetch fails, destroy the repository cache and re-clone from remote.
  * Update git fetch command to use + for heads and not just tags. "If the optional plus + is used, the local ref is updated even if it does not result in a fast-forward update."

## v2.3.7 (2013-11-18)

  * Supports new ey.yml option `ignore_gemfile_lock_warning`. When set to true, will not warn when Gemfile.lock is missing.
  * Fixes a bug introduced by 2.3.6 that caused tags to be fetched, but not heads. This prevented deployment of all branches that weren't tags.

## v2.3.6 (2013-11-15)

  * Fix a bug where force pushed tags and other branch changes are never fixed in the repository cache.

## v2.3.5 (2013-11-04)

  * Disable automatic git garbage collection. To reenable, add gc: true to ey.yml.
  * Put the hostname in the filename for integrate logs so that they aren't overwritten by other integrate actions, thus becoming undebuggable.

## v2.3.4 (2013-10-24)

  * More specific find command for permissions problems.
  * Fix file ownership on the integrate destination server before trying to rsync.

## v2.3.3 (2013-10-16)

  * Fixes a problem where symlinks were not chown'd correctly, causing invalid permissions for rsync.

## v2.3.2 (2013-10-09)

  * Add hooks `before_deploy` and `after_deploy` that happen near the beginning (after release directory is created) and at the end of the deploy task. 
  * Support option --clean which will force gems to be reinstalled (eg. when making a server architecture change that isn't already caught)
  * If dependncy manager options are set to blank, treat it like "detect".
  * Fix an issue with integrate action.

## v2.3.1 (2013-10-02)

  * Fix find maxdepth problem that causes shared/config files to by symlinked incorrectly.
  * Add `--no-dev` and `--optimize-autoloader` to default composer install command.
  * Supports new ey.yml options: `bundler`, `composer`, and `npm` which can be set to true or false to enable or disable each dependency manager.
  * Supports experimental ey.yml option: `restart_groups: n`. When set to a number `n` greater than 1, app servers are divided into `n` groups and each group is restarted serially.

## v2.3.0 (2013-08-07)

  * Abort rollbacks if unexpected files are found in the /data/app/releases/ directory because they disrupt the ability to find the previous and latest releases.
  * Accepts flags for git and archive strategies (`--git` and `--archive`) that are passed a uri
  * Changes the name of the Strategy class to Source.

## v2.2.1 (2013-07-29)

  * Fixes deprecation warnings for internal method calls in deploy hooks.

## v2.2.0 (2013-07-25)

  * Updates fallback bundler version to latest v1.3.5.
  * Supports using multiple dependency managers at the same time (bundler, composer, and/or npm)
  * Replaces command runner to address streaming log, idle connection, and random systemu failures.
  * Adds `config/application.rb` to the `asset_dependencies` to trigger asset precompilation.
  * Removes syncing of file modification times during push code operation in deploy. Syncing times occasionally causes unfixable permissions errors.
  * Clarifies inferred asset warning message.
  * Improves some of the maintenance page status messages.
  * Removes poorly encapsulated methods `config.enable_maintenance\_page?` and `config.disable_maintenance_page?`. Relocated to Maintenance class. (Check eydeploy.rb files)
  * Removes deprecated `c` method (use `config` instead)
  * In deploy hooks, deprecates @configuration (use `config`), @node (use `config.node`), and method\_missing access of config methods (use `config.method`).

## v2.1.4 (2013-06-17)

  * Don't reuse assets when there are no assets to reuse
  * Better composer support.

## v2.1.3 (2013-06-05)

  * Ensure LANG is set when gem install is run.

## v2.1.2 (2013-05-31)

  * Fixes a problem where Set#first was called in a ruby version that doesn't support it.

## v2.1.0 (2013-05-28)

  * Bumps default bundler version to latest 1.3.4
  * Fixes a race condition during deploy where `current` symlink was not moved atomically.
  * Don't precompile assets when git-diff shows no changes to `asset_dependencies`
  * Supports new ey.yml option `asset_dependencies` which is a list of relative paths to search for asset changes each deploy.
    * The default `asset_dependencies` are: app/assets lib/assets vendor/assets Gemfile.lock config/routes.rb
  * Supports new ey.yml option `precompile_unchanged_assets: true` compiles assets even if no changes would be detected.
  * Supports new ey.yml option `precompile_assets_task: taskname` which overrides the default `assets:precompile`
  * Supports new ey.yml option `asset_strategy` which supports: `shared`, `private`, `cleaning`, or `shifting`.
    * The default asset strategy is `shifting` which is the same behavior as previous versions.
    * See `README.markdown` or `lib/engineyard-serverside/rails_assets/strategy.rb` for full explanation.
  * Supports new ey.yml option `bundle_options` which can be used to specify additional bundle install command line options.
  * Supports setting of ey.yml option `bundle_without` to nil to remove `--without` from the bundle install command.
  * Refactor dependency management (bundler, npm, none) to allow more flexibility (may break existing eydeploy.rb files)
  * Supports new ey.yml option `eydeploy_rb: false` which enables or disables eydeploy.rb file loading. (defaults to enabled)
  * Changes the order of eydeploy.rb loading to happen after ey.yml is parsed during deploy.

## v2.0.7 (2013-05-16)

  * Fix encoding errors in logs when non-ascii characters are displayed.

## v2.0.6 (2013-04-08)

  * Fix for command line config option `--config precompile_assets:true/false` which was being interpreted as a string.
  * Don't exclude the `RAILS_ENV` Gemfile group from bundle install. (i.e. don't do `--without development` in `development` mode)

## v2.0.5 (2013-02-12)

  * Change concurrency code to use a simple threaded model.
  * Clean up local branches that might interfere with the git checkout.

## v2.0.4 (2012-12-17)

  * Supports new ey.yml option to control on which roles asset precompilation happens.
    * Must be a YAML Array syntax (using :app, :app\_master, :solo, :util) or :all.
    * Syntax: `asset_roles: :all (default is to exclude :util but include all others. [:app, :app_master, :solo])`
  * Adds `RAILS_GROUPS=assets` to rake assets:precompile to improve asset compilation performance.
  * Records exceptions raised during deploy into the deploy log when possible.
  * Fixes a bug where permissions problems may cause integrate action to fail.
  * Fixes a problem where "maintenance page still up" notice would stay on Cloud Dashboard too long. Downgraded message severity.
  * Garbage collect git at the end of each deploy. First one may take a while but the next ones will be faster and reduce extra disk usage.

## v2.0.3 (2012-09-24)

  * Make sure command line --config options get turned from strings into booleans if needed

## v2.0.2 (2012-09-19)

  * Only symlink shared config files that actually exist.
  * Don't display the database adapter warning when `nodatabase.yml` is present.
  * chown shared/bundled\_gems dir to deploy user to ensure bundle install works.

## v2.0.1 (2012-08-21)

  * Reduce the number of deprecation warnings.

## v2.0.0 (2012-08-16)

  * Default bundler version is now 1.1.5.
  * Deploy hooks now have access to `account_name` and `environment_name`.
  * Improves deploy output, especially for `--verbose`.
  * Sends all log output through a new Shell object that formats and adds timestamps.
  * Loads `ey.yml` or `config/ey.yml` to customize deploy settings.
  * Supports new ey.yml options to control automatic maintenance page:
  * `maintenance_on_restart: true or false (default: false except for glassfish and mongrel)`
  * `maintenance_on_migrate: true or false (default: true)`
  * Don't remove maintenance pages that weren't put up during this deploy if maintenance options (above) are set to false.
  * Supports new ey.yml options to control asset precompilation:
  * `precompile_assets: true or false (default: inferred using app/assets and config/application.rb)`
  * Supports new ey.yml option to ignore the missing database adapter warning:
  * `ignore_database_adapter_warning: true (default: false)`
  * Give better feedback when maintenance is enabled/disabled (or not).
  * Output a better error when a deploy hook fails.
  * Compile assets before maintenance page is installed.
  * Provide run! and sudo! to deploy hooks. If the command exits non-zero the deploy hook will fail, stopping the deploy.
